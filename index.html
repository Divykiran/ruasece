     <h3> M.Tech in VLSI and Nanotechnology </h3>
     <p>  Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) system design creates complex integrated circuits by combining millions and billions of transistors into a single chip. Our program trains students to design analog and digital integrated circuits using custom and semicustom design flow. We train students in the revolution of CMOS transistors, the miniaturisation of transistors, design methodology and the scaling of devices with nanotechnology.  </p>
